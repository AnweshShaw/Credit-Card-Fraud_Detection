# Credit-Card-Fraud_Detection
This repository contains our project submission for Hack Overflow 6.0. 
Our project detects fraud while using Credit Cards using ML Algorithms.

Algorithms Used:
1) Random Forest Classifier (RF Classifier)
2) Decision Tree 

Both Random Forest and Decision Tree are very effective in identifying fraudulent transactions and can help financial institutions prevent losses due to fraud. However, Random Forest tends to perform better than Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise and outliers.

Accuracy :
1) RF Model : 99.94 %
2) DT Model : 99.92 %

The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle.
