# Credit-Card-Fraud_Detection
This repository contains our project submission for Hack Overflow 6.0. 
Our project detects fraudulent activity while using Credit Cards using ML Algorithms.

i) Algorithms Used:
1) Random Forest Classifier (RF Classifier)
2) Decision Tree 

Both Random Forest and Decision Tree are very effective in identifying fraudulent transactions and can help financial institutions prevent losses due to fraud. However, Random Forest tends to perform better than Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise and outliers.

ii) Accuracy :
1) RF Model : 99.94 %
2) DT Model : 99.92 %

iii) Working:
1) A python code creates a GUI for taking input from user.
2) After collecting the input, it sends the data to the saved joblib model.
3) Next, the model analyses whether trnsaction is fraudulent or genuine using ML algorithms and returns the result.

The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle. (Dataset contains data of nearly 284,000 transactions which happened in 2013)
